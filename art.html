         This project required each student to create art using shapes as well as functions, conditions, loops, and a way to interact. So for my project, I decided <br>
         to draw a character from one of my all time favorite shows: Stan Marsh from South Park. I had to do a lot of drawing but I was finally able to come up with <br>
         something that I really liked. I created stan marsh. And in order for him to appear, the user must click on the canvas. He starts appearing a piece at a <br>
         time. Each click brings out a part of his body.

    <center><h2>Functions</h2></center>
        <p>
            For this project, I created many functions. At first, I just wanted to create stan. I wanted to create him then be able to interact with him someway. But I thought<br>
            that it would be really cool if I could click him on to the map kind of like in the intro of South Park where pieces of him come together. So to do this, I would <br>
            have to seperate the body, from the legs and the eyes, from the head and so on. So to break them up, I created a function for each of them. 
            <br><br><img src = "allanpics/functionscode1.png"><img src ="allanpics/functionscode2.png"><br><br>
            
            As you can see in my code, I have a lot of pushMatrix() and popMatrix(). The pushMatrix() saves the current coordinate system while the popMatrix restores the <br>
            original coordinate system. I had to use this element in my function because I used the rotate() element. The rotate element shifted the matrix at the point of <br>
            origin which made it difficult to add anything else because then it would be rotated like everything else. I also used a lot of translate(). This element would <br>
            change the origin to wherever I wanted it to be so I changed it to (300,440) so it looks like my character is standin on the side walk. The rest of the functions <br>
            are really just rectangles, triangles, ellipses, and curves put in a manner that makes a drawing of Stan Marsh.

    <center><h2>Interaction and condition</h2></center>
        <p>
            For this project, I only had one way for the user to interact. The way that the user would interact is by clicking on the canvas. clicking on the canvas would make <br>
            a piece of stan appear until he is complete. To do this, I first created a variable called stan and make stan = 0. After creating my variable, I said that if the <br>
            mouse is clicked, then add 1 to stan. Now that I have my numbers, I could create my drawing by saying, if stan > 0 then draw the legs. One initial problem I had was <br>
            I said if stan = 1 then draw the legs. This way didnt work because once stan was not = 0 then the legs would go behind the background making it look invisible.<br>

        </p>
    <center><h2>Loops</h2></center>
        <p>
           For this project, I didnt really want to use a loop but since I had to, I used the "for" loop. The way that I used a for loop is that I created an ellipse under the for<br>
           loop and added a setTimeout function. The for loop I created the variable i to make things easier for me. I wanted to make it look so that the flashing ellipses are on top <br>
           of stan and the i+=20 made it so. I made this so it would kind of make it look like an alien was placing him there or something. The for loop would draw the circle over<br>
           and over again while the setTimeout would wait one second before drawing the next set of circles. <br><br>
